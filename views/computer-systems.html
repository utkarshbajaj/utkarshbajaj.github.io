      <h2>Cache Simulator</h2>
      <p>
        Created a cache simulator from scratch in C. The simulator implemented
        an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache algorithm, taking the number of sets,
        blocks, and associativity (E) as input. It then processed a series of
        load and store instructions, calculating hits, misses, dirty bytes,
        evictions, and dirty bytes evicted. This project gave me hands-on
        experience with cache management and performance optimization. This is
        the current website you're onâ€”just a few static HTML pages linked
        together to showcase my work and thoughts!

      <h2>Dynamic Memory Allocator</h2>
      <p>
        Implemented a dynamic memory allocator, including functions like malloc,
        free, and realloc, to manage memory efficiently. The project involved
        designing allocation strategies such as free lists and best-fit
        allocation to reduce fragmentation and maximize throughput. This
        experience enhanced my understanding of heap-based memory management,
        data alignment, and low-level system operations.

      <h2>Tiny Shell</h2>
      <p>
        Built a Unix-like tiny shell to explore process management and system
        interaction. The shell supported executing commands, managing foreground
        and background jobs, and handling signals. Using system calls like fork,
        exec, and wait, I gained practical insights into process creation,
        execution, and control, deepening my understanding of how operating
        systems handle command execution.
      </p>
      <h2>Web Proxy</h2>
      <p>
        Developed a multithreaded web proxy server to handle HTTP requests and
        responses efficiently. The proxy supported caching and concurrent
        connections, enabling it to manage multiple client requests
        simultaneously. This project provided hands-on experience with network
        programming, socket communication, and HTTP protocol handling, enhancing
        my understanding of the architecture of networked applications.

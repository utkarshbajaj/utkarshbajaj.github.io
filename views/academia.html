        This semester, I’ve been deep-diving into a class on low-level computer
        concepts—think assembly, cache, virtual memory, and all that good stuff.
        It’s been super challenging but also insanely rewarding. I've picked up
        a bunch of stuff I never really thought about before, like how things
        actually work under the hood instead of just focusing on the
        higher-level programming side.

        Honestly, I think every CS student should get a taste of this because it
        changes how you see code and understand how it really runs on a machine.
        Plus, the labs have been a blast and sparked a growing interest in
        coding in C. So, I’m definitely planning to dive into more C projects
        soon and see where it takes me.

        This semester, I’ve been deep-diving into a class on low-level computer
        concepts—think assembly, cache, memory allocation, and all that good
        stuff. It’s been super challenging but also insanely rewarding. I've
        picked up a bunch of stuff I never really thought about before, like how
        things actually work under the hood instead of just focusing on the
        higher-level programming side.
      </p>
      <p>
        Honestly, I think every CS student should get a taste of this because it
        changes how you see code and understand how it really runs on a machine.
        Plus, the labs have been a blast and sparked a growing interest in
        coding in C. So, I’m definitely planning to dive into more C projects
        soon and see where it takes me.

      <p>
        In my Functional Programming class, I gained a solid foundation in
        functional paradigms, learning key concepts such as immutability, pure
        functions, tail recursion, higher-order functions, map-reduce, function
        composition, and pattern matching. Throughout the course, I applied
        these techniques to develop a crypto arbitrage identifier, which
        efficiently analyzed cryptocurrency market discrepancies.
